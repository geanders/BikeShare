# Chemical descriptors 

**Chemical descriptors**: "There are myriad types of descriptors that can be derived from a chemical equation."

Examples: 

- number of carbon atoms
- molecular weight
- electrical charge
- surface area

# QSAR

A key task in drug development is determining which compounds have certain biological activity. \bigskip

**Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling:** Try to determine something like biological activity (e.g., if it can inhibit production of a specific protein) from chemical descriptors of the chemical (including for componds that don't yet exist). \bigskip

This is usually determined through experimentation.

# Other compound characteristics

In addition to a compound's activity, you also need to figure out other properties, to determine if it could be used for a drug: 

- Solubility
- Toxicity

# Purpose of model

**Model aim**: Predict whether the solubility of a chemical compound based on its *chemical descriptors*.

- Training data: 1,267 chemical compounds

For each compound, solubility was determined experimentally.

# Predictive variables

Predictive variables include: 

- 208 binary "fingerprints" indicating the presence or absence of a particular chemical structure
- 16 count variables (e.g., number of bonds, number of bromine atoms)
- 4 continuous descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, surface area)

# Evaluation

Solubility was converted to the $\log_{10}$ scale. \bigskip

Models were assessed using root mean squared error (RMSE).

# Exploratory data analysis

Shape of distributions for predictors: 

> "The count-based descriptors show a significant right skewness."

They assessed this by measuring an average skewness statistic. 

# Splitting data

They randomly split the data into training and testing sets: 

- Training dataset: 951 chemical compounds
- Test dataset: 316 chemical compounds

> "The training set will be used to tune and estimate models, as well as to determine initial estimates of performance using repeated 10-fold cross-validation. The test set will be used for a final characterization of the models of interest."

# Pre-processing

For the binary variables, "there is very little that pre-processing will accomplish".

# Pre-processing

For continuous variables, two of the issues of concern are: 

- Skewness
- Between-predictor correlations

# Pre-processing

To account for skewness, they applied a Box-Cox transformation to all of the continuous predictors. \bigskip

In `caret`, you can do this using the `preProcess` function, with `"BoxCox"` as one of the options in the `method` argument.

# Feature engineering

Added quadratic terms for continuous variables.
